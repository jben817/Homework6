homework 6

Homework was to create a weather dashboard. A user would be able to search and city and current weather and five day forcast including City name, date, weather icon, temp, humidity, Wind Speed and UV index. UV index was suppose to give a severity warning. The city and information was to be saved to local storage so user could click and retrieve information.

I was able to provided city search and some aspects of weather conditions in five day forecast. I was unable to retrieve UV index, couldn't figured out how to manipulate the city name into lat/long and get from API. I also kept getting an undefined error message when trying to get the weather icons. I also feel like I probably should have used a loop somehow.
